Documentation:
* change doc/Makefile to enforce LANG=C
* complete switch to GAPDoc: Verify everything converted fine, then remove old docs

Misc:
* redo stuff in /etc; need a new script for making release tarballs
* Add GPL header to all files
* Update the versions and release dates in PackageInfo.g *AND* CHANGES
* Write a checklist (or maybe a script) for everything that needs to be
  done during a release. E.g. setting version & release date (and where:
  PackageInfo.g, docu, configure, website, ...)

Code:
* Document changes made to AbelianPcpGroup in 2.2->2.6 (it now accepts
  more parameter formats)
* fix things from my bug list
* add some of my new internal code
* add unit tests
* IsomorphismPcpGroupFromFpGroupWithPcPres
  should this be Installed as a global function, considering that 
  it is documented now?
  other new globals (write protected):
    IsPcpElementCollection( ... )*
    IsPcpElementFamily( ... )*
  other new globals (not write protected):
	PcpFamily*
	PcpType*
	PolycyclicPkgName*
	USE_CANONICAL_PCS*
	USE_NORMED_PCS*

* MappedVector is used by lots of code, and also by 3rd party
  packages -> make it official & document it.
  Then again, the GAP core also contains a similar function with equal name. Oops

* add support for cohomology over arbitrary finite modules

* set CanEasilyCompareElements / CanEasilyCompareElementsFamily ?
* CanEasilySortElements / CanEasilySortElementsFamily ?

* Should we use InstallSubsetMaintenance etc.?

* the methods for IsomorphismPcpGroup could be improved, e.g. the
  one starting with a permutation group, or with a pc group

* Maybe add IsFreeAbelian, IsTorsionFree, property to GAP, and just install
  methods for pcp groups in polycyclic. CAREFUL with GAP 4.4 compatibility,
  and also beware of issues where users upgrade from an old polycyclic
  version to newer GAP... ideally, such a change should be made
  *before* GAP 4.5 is introduced.

* could also extend TorsionSubgroup to finite groups

* The third parameter "snf" in  Pcp( U, "snf" )
  is really an "option", and should be replaced by use of ValueOption()
  Similar for "all" in PrintPcpPresentation()
